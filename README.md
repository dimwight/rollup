# rollup

- From rollup-starter-app
- TS supported inc sourcemaps
- Debug frames
- Headless with Node
- Test for tree-shaking
- And for splitting
- And also for dual-format bundles!
- But a puzzle:
```
C:\Users\Me\ts\rollup\public\dateTs.js
Bundling to public/rollup.js
Warning: No name was provided for external module 'C:\Users\Me\ts\rollup\public\dateTs.js' in options.globals â€“ guessing 'date'
```
